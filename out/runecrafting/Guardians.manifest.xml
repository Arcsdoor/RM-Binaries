        GPU plugin render distance = 40
        Camera plugin zoom out = 150
        Entity hider reduces lag
        ****Options****
        Chisel in inventory = Assembly of guardians for extra points / Low chance to construct + Favors crafting elemental runes
        Rune pouch in inventory = Disable collecting cells to make runes slightly faster / +XP -Points + Favors crafting *good* catalytic runes
        Abyssal pearls in inventory = Attempts to repair pouches at the end of the game
        Disable the portal talismans of bad runes
        ***************
        My Setup = 3 biggest pouches or colossal pouch and rune pouch with the best catalytic runes. Mining/Max Cape + Varrock chest + Crystal pickaxe + Celestial signet increases XP
        Scans RC lvl and quests done for 4 types of catalytic runes
        Default = [Blood, Death, Law, Nature]
        No Quests = [Nature, Chaos, Body, Mind]
        To override have 4 catalytic runes and start bot
        Implementation of combination runes is possible for the future / Risk of missing games due to player limit and banking
